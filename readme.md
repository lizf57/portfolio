# Portfolio-Project

<h2>Module 2 Challenge: Advanced CSS</h2>

For this week's challenge, I created a portfolio using HTML and CSS. 

The purpose of creating this portfolio was to showcase my present and future web development projects for potential employers. 

The skills I used for this portfolio reflect what I have learned in the first few weeks of the Coding Bootcamp, as well as working toward maintaining all requirements needed to complete the project. 

The requirements for the project are listed below:

- Developer's name and a recent photo are presented to the user when the portfolio is loaded. 

- inks for an "About Me" section, "My Work" section, and "Contact Me" section are active and will scroll to the corresponding section when clicked on. 

- When the user clicks on an image in the "My Work" section, it takes the user to the corresponding developer's applications.

- The developer's first application should be the largest image compared to other projects. 

- When the page is resized, it will adapt to the viewport.
